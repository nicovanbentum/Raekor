# Build

### Windows
Use the supplied Visual Studio Project, binaries for SDL2 and Assimp are included.

### Linux
Used to work through our makefile, but it's out of date.

# Features
Some experimentals are in place for DirectX 11 and Vulkan. Focus has shifted to getting features in fast in OpenGL so I can use the engine to  research and implement Global Illumination for a research course at the Hogeschool Utrecht. Some of the features currently being worked on:
- [X] Shader hotloading
- [X] Directional & Point lighting
- [X] Shadow mapping (point & directional)
- [X] Normal mapping
- [X] HDR, Gamma & Tone mapping
- [X] Deferred render pipeline
- [ ] PBR Material system
- [X] Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
- [ ] Screen Space Reflections
- [ ] Global Illumination (multiple techniques)
- [ ] Scripting language
- [x] Data driven Entity Component System
